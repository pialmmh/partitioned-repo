- Multiple shard operations failing
- Update and delete operations across 3 shards not working

#### 3. **DatewiseMultiTableTest** (1 Failure)
- `testQueryAcrossMultipleDays` - Finding fewer events than expected

#### 4. **PerformanceTest** (1 Error)
- Concurrent operations failing under load

#### 5. **SingleShardPaginationTest** (1 Failure)
- `testPaginationAcrossTables` - Pagination across multiple daily tables

#### 6. **ComprehensiveStrategyTest** (3 Failures, 1 Error)
- Date range queries with hourly/daily partitioning
- Delete operations with date ranges
- Update operations failing

## Analysis

### Working Features ✅
- Basic CRUD operations (insert, find, update, delete)
- Single table operations
- Date range queries in simple scenarios
- Single shard operations
- API validation

### Problem Areas ❌
1. **Multi-shard operations** - Pagination throws expected exception
2. **Complex date range queries** - Edge cases with time boundaries
3. **Concurrent operations** - Race conditions under load
4. **Cross-table pagination** - Issues when paginating across multiple daily tables
5. **Multi-condition operations** - Operations with ID + date range filters

### Root Causes
1. **Multi-shard pagination** - Intentionally not implemented (throws exception as designed)
2. **Date/time boundary issues** - Queries not capturing all events at day boundaries
3. **Table selection logic** - Not including all relevant tables for date ranges
4. **Concurrent access** - Missing synchronization or retry logic
5. **Complex WHERE clauses** - Multiple conditions not properly handled

## Recommendations
1. Most core functionality works (72.5% pass rate)
2. Multi-shard pagination needs future implementation (currently throws exception by design)
3. Date range query logic needs refinement for edge cases
4. Consider adding retry logic for concurrent operations
5. Cross-table operations need better coordination
